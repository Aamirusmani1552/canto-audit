// @audit points to keep in mind during audit

- $NOTE is backed by $USDC and $USDT, and $USYC
- For every $NOTE in circulation, there is more than 1 USD worth of collateral held by the CLM
- Transfer is an ERC-20 method that allows accounts to send tokens to other Ethereum addresses. A cToken transfer will fail if the account has entered that cToken market and the transfer would have put the account into a state of negative liquidity.
